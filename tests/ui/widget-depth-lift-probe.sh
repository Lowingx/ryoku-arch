# widget-depth-lift-probe: the `Depth` lift row in a desktop widget's right-click
# menu (WidgetMenu), a plugin tile's menu (PluginWidgetMenu), and the
# visualiser's own menu scope writes the shared `front` list on stage.json
# through the stage Config singleton: it toggles the named widget only, hides
# itself while the wallpaper has no cut-out, keeps the menu card open on trigger, and
# persists across the seam (the wrapper greps the written file after the run).
# Loads the real components against a mirrored shell/ tree, the way
# center-popout-probe.sh does. Commit nothing.
